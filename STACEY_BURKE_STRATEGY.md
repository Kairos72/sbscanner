## 1. Core Trading Philosophy

### The Market Only Does 3 Things:

1. **Breakout and Trend**
   - Market breaks out of range and continues
   - Creates directional moves
   - Follow-through momentum

2. **Breakout and Reverse (False Break)**
   - Market attempts breakout but fails
   - Traps traders on wrong side
   - Reversal from failed breakout

3. **Trading Range (Consolidation)**
   - Market moves sideways
   - Accumulation/Distribution
   - Inside days and range days

### Key Principles:
- Markets operate in cycles
- 3-day cycles are fundamental
- Identify where traders are trapped
- Trade with the path of least resistance
- Higher timeframes control lower timeframes

## 2. Market Structure Theory

### Market Structure Concepts:

**Peak Formations:**
- Identify where retail traders are trapped
- Market resets after peaks
- New anchor points established
- Can occur after 2-5 days of directional movement

**Market Resets:**
- Represent new anchor points
- Signal shift in market structure
- Often occur at extremes
- Provide fresh entry opportunities

**Timeframe Hierarchy:**
1. Weekly (Direction)
2. Daily (Structure)
3. H4 (Entry zones)
4. H1 (Triggers)

## 3. The ACB System

### ACB = AIN'T COMING BACK

**Definition**: Areas where smart money positions that won't be tested again.

### The Three Essential Elements

1. **DAILY MARKET CYCLE (D-M-C)**
   - The natural rhythm of market manipulation
   - Smart money creates cycles to trap retail
   - 3-day cycle is the foundation

2. **DAILY MARKET ROTATION (D-M-R)**
   - Where markets rotate back to after manipulation
   - These become ACB levels when broken
   - Key reference points for entries

3. **DAILY MARKET ROTATION LEVEL (D-M-R-L)**
   - Specific price levels for rotation
   - Used for stop placement and targets
   - Areas of liquidity

### Core ACB Concepts

**MSMM (Market Structure & Market Manipulation)**:
- Markets only do 3 things: Up, Down, Sideways
- Each action has 2 components: Push and rotation
- Time is crucial for understanding manipulation

**Targeted Liquidity**:
- 3-day liquidity targets
- Stop hunts at key levels
- Inducement patterns to trap retail

**Time-Price Relationship**:
- 60/40 rule: 60% price, 40% time
- Markets manipulate through time
- Session analysis critical

## 4. Key Patterns & Setups

### Pattern Definitions:

#### 1. FRD - First Red Day (A+ vs A Setups)

**A+ Setup (3DL + FRD):**
- **Definition**: First red candle after 3+ consecutive green candles
- **Signal**: Maximum exhaustion, high probability reversal
- **Context**: After 3 consecutive green daily candles (3 Days of Longs)
- **Pattern**: Green, Green, Green, **RED (Trigger)**
- **Action**: Next day, look for shorts above FRD high
- **Quality**: Highest probability, but less frequent

**A Setup (2DL + FRD):**
- **Definition**: Red candle after 2 consecutive green days
- **Signal**: Early reversal signal, more frequent
- **Pattern**: Green, Green, **RED (Trigger)**
- **Action**: Next day, look for shorts above trigger high
- **Quality**: Good probability, more opportunities

#### 2. FGD - First Green Day (A+ vs A Setups)

**A+ Setup (3DS + FGD):**
- **Definition**: First green candle after 3+ consecutive red candles
- **Signal**: Maximum oversold, high probability reversal
- **Context**: After 3 consecutive red daily candles (3 Days of Shorts)
- **Pattern**: Red, Red, Red, **GREEN (Trigger)**
- **Action**: Next day, look for longs below FGD low
- **Quality**: Highest probability, but less frequent

**A Setup (2DS + FGD):**
- **Definition**: Green candle after 2 consecutive red days
- **Signal**: Early reversal signal, more frequent
- **Pattern**: Red, Red, **GREEN (Trigger)**
- **Action**: Next day, look for longs below trigger low
- **Quality**: Good probability, more opportunities

#### Setup Grading System

**A+ Setups (3-Day Count):**
- Higher win rate
- Stronger momentum buildup
- More trapped retail traders
- Better risk/reward ratios
- Wait for these in strong trends

**A Setups (2-Day Count):**
- More frequent occurrences
- Earlier entries
- Faster markets
- Good for active trading
- Take these in ranging/volatile markets

#### 4. Pump & Dump Patterns

**Five Main P&D Setups:**

1. **Equilibrium P&D**

3. Enter short on first pullback
4. Stop: FRD high + 5-10 pips
5. Target: Previous low or 1:2 RR

2. Trail stop after 1:1 RR achieved
3. Scale out at 50% of target
4. Full exit if reversal pattern forms

## 5. Risk Management

### Risk Management Rules:

**Position Sizing:**
- Risk 1% per trade maximum
- Adjust based on volatility

**H4 (4H):**
- Entry zone identification
- Smaller structure within daily
- Confirmation of setup

**H1 (1H):**
- Trigger identification
- Precise entry points
- Stop loss placement

### Rules:
- Higher timeframe controls lower
- No H1 trades against D1 trend
- Wait for alignment across timeframes

## 8. Weekly Template (Monday-Wednesday Structure)

### The Core Weekly Pattern

Based on ACB methodology, the week has a specific structure:

**Monday-Tuesday: Frontside (Range Building)**
- Establish weekly boundaries
- Accumulation phase for smart money
- Asian session: Range definition
- London session: Initial tests

**Wednesday: The Pivot (Structure Break)**
- Peak formation or reversal point
- Market maker manipulation peak
- High volatility and volume
- Transition point

**Thursday-Friday: Backside (New Cycle)**
- New trend development
- Distribution from smart money
- Completion of weekly structure

### Session Analysis (Critical for ACB)

**Asian Session (Range Building)**
- Establishes daily range
- Smart money positioning
- Low volatility, accumulation

**London Session (Manipulation)**
- Breakout of Asian range
- Inducement patterns
- Stop hunting activity
- False breakouts common

**New York Session (Confirmation)**
- Real direction revealed
- Smart money profit-taking
- Trend continuation or reversal
- Volume confirmation

### Daily Market Cycle Alignment

**Daily Market Cycle Phases:**
1. **Establishment** (Asian)
2. **Manipulation** (London)
3. **Confirmation** (NY)
4. **Distribution** (Late NY)

**How Weekly & Daily Cycles Interact:**
- Monday-Wednesday: Align with 3-day daily cycles
- Wednesday is both weekly and daily pivot
- Thursday starts new cycles
- Friday completes patterns

### ACB Weekly Strategy

**Identify Weekly Structure:**
1. Monday/Tuesday: Mark weekly range
2. Wednesday: Watch for break/rejection
3. Thursday: Trade new direction
4. Friday: Manage positions

**Key ACB Levels:**
- Weekly high/low become DMR levels
- Break of weekly ranges = potential ACB
- 3-day targets align with weekly structure
