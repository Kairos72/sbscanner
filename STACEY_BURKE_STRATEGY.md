## 1. Core Trading Philosophy

### The Market Only Does 3 Things:

1. **Breakout and Trend**
   - Market breaks out of range and continues
   - Creates directional moves
   - Follow-through momentum

2. **Breakout and Reverse (False Break)**
   - Market attempts breakout but fails
   - Traps traders on wrong side
   - Reversal from failed breakout

3. **Trading Range (Consolidation)**
   - Market moves sideways
   - Accumulation/Distribution
   - Inside days and range days

### Key Principles:
- Markets operate in cycles
- 3-day cycles are fundamental
- Identify where traders are trapped
- Trade with the path of least resistance
- Higher timeframes control lower timeframes

## 2. Market Structure Theory

### Market Structure Concepts:

**Peak Formations:**
- Identify where retail traders are trapped
- Market resets after peaks
- New anchor points established

**Market Resets:**
- Represent new anchor points
- Signal shift in market structure
- Often occur at extremes
- Provide fresh entry opportunities

**Timeframe Hierarchy:**
1. Weekly (Direction)
2. Daily (Structure)
3. H4 (Entry zones)
4. H1 (Triggers)
